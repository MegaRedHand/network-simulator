### Left Bar
The left bar contains buttons to add devices to the network. You can add the following devices:

- **Host**: A computer or device that connects to the network.
- **Router**: A device that forwards data packets between computer networks.
- **Switch**: A device that connects devices within a single network and uses MAC addresses to forward data to the correct destination.

In order to add a device, just click on the corresponding button and the selected device will appear in the center of the canvas.
Depending on the selected layer, different devices will be added.
